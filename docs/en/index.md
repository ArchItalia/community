## What is Archlinux?


Arch Linux is an independently developed GNU/Linux distribution for general-purpose use on x86-64 architecture, where the software version tends to always be the latest stable available, following the rolling-release release model. The default installation is a minimal basic system: it is then up to the user to configure the system by adding only what he actually needs.
